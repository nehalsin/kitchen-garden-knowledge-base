# Moderated Channel Benefits

Dear Member,

Thank you for joining this group. 

You are now invited to migrate to Telegram channel for the same, for better quality, curated posts only after due moderation. 

Groups provide easy mechanism for p2p sharing, however it has been observed that unmoderated groups become easy gateway for irrelevant content posting that waste precious time of members.

Please find link of Kitchen Garden Community channel here: [https://t.me/kitchengardencommunity](https://t.me/kitchengardencommunity) or can simply be found by username **@kitchengardencommunity**. 

Sorry for any inconveniences caused.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. 

Wishing you good learning and healthy experience in togetherness with the volunteer team and other members. :-)
